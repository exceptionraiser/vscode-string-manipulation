## üéõÔ∏è Custom Commands

Create your own regex-based string manipulation commands! Define custom transformations that fit your specific workflow needs.

### Quick Start with Custom Commands

1. **Select text** in your editor
2. **Open Command Palette** (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
3. **Type "String Manipulation: Custom Command"**
4. **Choose from your configured commands** (or add some if none exist)

### Setting Up Custom Commands

Add custom commands to your VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "stringManipulation.customCommands": [
    {
      "name": "Extract Numbers",
      "searchPattern": "[^0-9]",
      "replacement": "",
      "global": true
    },
    {
      "name": "Wrap in Quotes",
      "searchPattern": "^(.*)$",
      "replacement": "\"$1\""
    },
    {
      "name": "Camel to Snake",
      "searchPattern": "([a-z])([A-Z])",
      "replacement": "$1_$2",
      "global": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Regular Expression Flags

Use intuitive boolean properties instead of cryptic flag letters. See the [MDN RegExp flags documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions#advanced_searching_with_flags) for detailed information.

| Property | Flag | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `global` | `g` | Find all matches rather than stopping after the first |
| `ignoreCase` | `i` | Case-insensitive search |
| `multiline` | `m` | `^` and `$` match start/end of line |
| `dotAll` | `s` | `.` matches newline characters |
| `unicode` | `u` | Enable full Unicode support |
| `sticky` | `y` | Match only at specific index |

### Custom Command Features

- **üîç Live Previews**: See transformation results before applying
- **‚úÖ Validation**: Real-time regex pattern validation with helpful errors
- **üîÑ Multi-selection**: Works with multiple text selections
- **üéØ Saved & Reusable**: Your commands are stored and accessible anytime
